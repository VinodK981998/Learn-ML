In this assignment 
- Use iris flower dataset from sklearn library and try to form clusters of flowers using petal width and length features. Drop other two features for simplicity.
- Figure out if any preprocessing such as scaling would help here
- Draw elbow plot and from that figure out optimal value of k



Kmean

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct groups,
or clusters, based on similarity patterns. It seeks to minimize the variance within clusters by iteratively assigning data
points to the nearest cluster center and updating those centers. K-means is versatile and widely applied in various fields,
such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection, to uncover hidden structures in data and aid in 
decision-making.
