svm_iris = 
Train SVM classifier to identify type of iris flower

svm_digits = 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Exercise(Digits)
Train SVM classifier using sklearn digits dataset (i.e. from sklearn.datasets import load_digits) and then,

Measure accuracy of your model using different kernels such as rbf and linear.
Tune your model further using regularization and gamma parameters and try to come up with highest accurancy score
Use 80% of samples as training data size

Have also implimented cross validation using GridSearch to identify best method and accuracy
